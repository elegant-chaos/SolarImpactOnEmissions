Initial goals:
- Create calculator that TAKES zip code, building type, square footage, and 
  percent of power replaced and RETURNS emissions saved (focus on carbon first)

Stretch goals:
- Create cool data viz to quantify the impact. Can include maps, comparisons to 
  other carbon emitting activities. Anything really.
